Bayesian Spam Filter
==================

A very simple Bayesian Spam Filtering implementation in python.

Requires a "base.txt" that serves as an email data base and a "e1.txt" that represent the emails to be determined as spam or not. Each row in both files represents a single email.

"base.txt" contains 47 columns:

	column 1 to 45 indicates a word occurrences in an email
	
	column 46 indicates the total amount of words of an email
	
	column 47 indicates if that email is considered spam or not
	
"e1.txt" contains 47 columns:

	column 1 to 45 indicates whether the word appears in the mail or not
